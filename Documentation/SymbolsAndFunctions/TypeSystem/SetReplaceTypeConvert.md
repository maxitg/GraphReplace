# SetReplaceTypeConvert

**`SetReplaceTypeConvert`** allows one to convert one type (of, e.g., `Multihistory`) into another:

```wl
SetReplaceTypeConvert[newType][object]
```

It can be used for optimization or to explicitly serialize an object that is, e.g., attached to a C++ instance.

However, we have not implemented any types yet, so it's impossible to use this yet.
