# Systems

*SetReplace* supports multiple computational systems. They are all treated within a unified framework, i.e., their
[multihistories](/Documentation/Types/Multihistory/README.md) can be created with
[generators](/Documentation/Generators/README.md) using similar parameters, and their
[properties](/Documentation/Properties/README.md) are computed in a simliar way.
