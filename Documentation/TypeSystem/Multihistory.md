# Multihistory

**`Multihistory`** represents an evaluation history of a computational system.

It is part of the new *SetReplace* [type system](README.md) which we are actively working on. We have not implemented
any generators or properties yet, so it's not currently possible to create or use any `Multihistory` objects.
