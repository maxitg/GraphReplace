  result /; result =!= $Failed
];

(* Algorithm has 3 steps:
    1. First, convert the hypergraph into a normal Graph preserving structure (but adding new vertices).
    2. Then, compute the automorhpism group for that normal Graph.
    3. Finally, remove added auxiliary vertices from the spec of that group. *)

hypergraphAutomorphismGroup[hypergraph : {{Except[_List]...}...}] := With[{

  Join[
    EdgeList[PathGraph[edgeVertices, DirectedEdges -> True]],
    Thread[DirectedEdge[edgeVertices, hyperedge]]]
];

(* Note, auxiliary vertices cannot mix with original vertices in the same cycle, since auxiliary vertices have
    out-degrees of at least 1, whereas original vertices always have out-degree 0.
    Hence, here we are taking a subgroup by identifying permutations of auxiliary vertices.
    In the original group there are either auxiliary-only generators (which would be turned into empty Cycles[{}]
    and deleted), generators affecting both (which will be trimmed), and generators of original vertices only
    (which will be preserved).*)
