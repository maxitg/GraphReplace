Add a picture for the project if possible.

### The project goal

A brief description of what the project is trying to achieve. Remember, the summer school is only four weeks long, and
in practice, there is only enough time to work for 2-3 of those weeks.

* A specific deliverable of a project (*SetReplace* symbol, research note, etc.).
* Another deliverable, if any.

## Motivations

An explanation of how the project will fit into the bigger picture. Will this project be a part of a longer-term effort?
Add links to existing research notes/PRs/issues that are part of that effort.

### External prerequisites

The things (external to *SetReplace*) the student must know to complete the project successfully. These are the things
we will expect the student to have experience with before summer school. For example:

* Familiarity with graphs.
* Familiarity with linear algebra.
* C++ experience.
* Basic understanding of path integrals.

### *SetReplace* prerequisites

*SetReplace* concepts the student will need to understand to complete the project. It's nice for students to understand
these ahead of time, but they can instead learn them during the first week. All the items below should have links to
documentation/research notes. For example:

* Basic understanding of
  [token-event graphs](/Documentation/SymbolsAndFunctions/WolframModelAndWolframModelEvolutionObject/Properties/ExpressionSeparations.md).
* Familiarity with the
  [`GeneralizedGridGraph`](/Documentation/SymbolsAndFunctions/UtilityFunctions/GeneralizedGridGraph.md) function.

### Difficulty

Given prerequisites, how difficult do you think the project is? What would be the most challenging about it? Are there
any risks involved? If the project might end up being impossible, explain that here.

### Potential instructors

A list of `@instructor`s who might be able to mentor this project.

### Existing work

Has anything been done in the direction of this project? If you can think of any external or internal links, put them
here.

### Required future *SetReplace* features

Are any *SetReplace* features that don't exist yet required **before** the start of the project? Put them here. This
includes planned but not yet implemented features.
