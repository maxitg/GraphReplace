Add a picture for the project if possible.

### The project goal

A brief description of what the project is trying to achieve (remember, the summer school is only 4 weeks long).

* A specific deliverable of a project (*SetReplace* symbol, research note, etc.).
* Another deliverable if any.

### External prerequisites

The things (external to *SetReplace*) the student is required to know in order to successfully complete the project.
These are the things the student will be expected to have experience with before the summer school. For example:

* C++ experience.
* Basic understanding of path integrals.

### *SetReplace* prerequisites

*SetReplace* concepts the student will need to understand in order to complete the project. It's nice for students to
understand these ahead of time, but they can instead learn them during the first week. All the items below should have
links to documentation/research notes. For example:

* Basic understanding of
  [token-event graphs](/Documentation/SymbolsAndFunctions/WolframModelAndWolframModelEvolutionObject/Properties/ExpressionSeparations.md).
* Familiarity with the
  [`GeneralizedGridGraph`](/Documentation/SymbolsAndFunctions/UtilityFunctions/GeneralizedGridGraph.md) function.

### Potential instructors
